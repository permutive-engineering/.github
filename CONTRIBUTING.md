# Contributing

If you have any question or problem feel free to open an issue or discussion.

People are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when discussing on the GitHub issues or PRs.

## How can I help?

The process is simple:

 1. Find something you want to work on.

    Any contribution is welcome. Don't hesitate!

 2. Fork and clone the repository.
 
 3. Implement your contribution.

    Ensure the code is formatted before sending a Pull Request.

 4. Write tests.

    Take into account that different projects have different types of tests.

 5. Update the documentation.

    For most of the projects documentation lives in the `.github/docs/README.md`. Some other projects may have a generated static site with wider docs.

 6. Submit a pull request.

    And it's done! ðŸŽ‰
